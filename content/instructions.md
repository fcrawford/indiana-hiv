This web application shows the dynamics of the HIV outbreak in Scott County, Indiana from April 2011 through September 2015, and estimates of outbreak dynamics if, contrary to fact, the diagnostic scale-up had occurred earlier in the epidemic. 

Click on an intervention scenario below to evaluate the effect of earlier scale-up of case-finding and harm reduction on cumulative HIV incidence.  To evaluate the effect of intervening on other dates, click on the slider bar drag it left.  The left-hand slider button moves the start date of case-finding scale-up; the right-hand button moves the date at which case-finding rate is held constant following scale-up.
